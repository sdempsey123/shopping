## Spend less
This acts as the homepage on this WordPress website as I explain how I developed a routine to find the best deals when I go shopping.

## Groceries

This is the most important item on anyone's shopping list since users have to get food, drink and other necessities on a weekly or daily basis. So it's crucial that users do their homework and even shop at multiple stores to find the best deals possible. It really adds up at the end.

## Cars

With the price of oil going through the roof, this is one of the bigger challenges to anyone's personal budget. The key is to find the best price possible for gas, which means users can go to stations like Rotten Robbie or other independent outlets. The same applies to oil changes. Go online and you should find some good deals. 

## Clothes

This is one of the more challenging areas of your budget, but there are a lot of stores out there that carry quality merchandies at low prices, such as Kohl's, Ross, and Marshall's. You can go online as well, but beware that the sizes you find online may not match the sizes that fit you.

## Recreation

Of course, you need to get some exercise or go out and have some fun, but the prices can be pretty steep. You need to ask yourself if that $1,500 exercise machine or an expensive gym is really worth it. Ditto for paying to play golf where equpiment can go into the thousands. Get used clubs and maybe some weights to do workouts from home.
